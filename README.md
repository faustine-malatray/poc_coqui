This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Purpose

This is a POC developed to learn how to use Coqui.
It implements simple logic to play an audio generated by a Coqui pre-trained voice. 

## To do to reuse the code

Change the API_KEY variable in ./app/pages.tsx in :
```bash 
handleCoquiDownload
``` 
You'll probably want to refactor the code.
